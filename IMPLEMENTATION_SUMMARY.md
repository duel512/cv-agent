2. **Scales to hundreds of conversations** without manual effort
3. **Costs less than a coffee** per month to run
4. **Updates easily** by editing a JSON file
5. **Showcases your skills** in:
   - Full-stack development

---

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Why This Approach is Smart

1. **No fine-tuning needed**: Your CV fits entirely in the context window
2. **No database needed**: JSON file is perfect for static data
3. **No RAG needed**: Data is small enough to include in every request
4. **Serverless architecture**: Scales automatically, pay only for usage
5. **Vendor flexibility**: Can switch LLM providers easily
6. **Easy maintenance**: Update JSON → redeploy → done

### Architecture Decisions

- **FastAPI** (not Flask): Better async support, auto-generated docs
- **Vanilla JS** (not React): Simpler, faster, no build step needed
- **Railway** (not Heroku): Better pricing, modern platform
- **Netlify** (not Vercel): Free tier allows commercial use
- **JSON file** (not database): Simpler, faster, cheaper
- **GPT-3.5** (not GPT-4): 10x cheaper, still great quality
